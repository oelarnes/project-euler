This folder contains solutions to problems from projecteuler.net. The 
problems are copied from the project euler website and pasted at the top 
of each page, except for a few cases where formatting made this difficult. 
Running each program should output the correct answer to the problem as 
posed.  

This is not intended as a repository for solutions to be used by 
others, but as an example of my code. Please do not copy my answers and 
submit them under a different user name, for the sake of the integrity of 
the project.  

All solutions and code are authored by me. For example, the 
sieve in p3 is based on discussions about implementation with others, but 
no other code was referenced.
